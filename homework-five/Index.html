    <h1>Choose Your Own Adventure: Bump In The Night</h1>

    <p>
      It's a dark and spooky night. You are alone in your home when you heard a
      strange noise outside. You don't know what it could be. Is it a friend? Or
      a foe? Will you live? Or will you meet a tragic end? It's your choice.
